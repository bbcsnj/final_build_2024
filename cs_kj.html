      <h4>Biography</h4>
      <p><span class="strong">Katherine Johnson</span> was an American computer scientist. Katherine's childhood had a lot of adversity since African-American education past the eighth grade was not offered. With a gift for mathematics, Katherine's parents managed to enroll her in a high school where she excelled. She again succeeded at college and went on to be the first African-American woman to enroll at the graduate level at the West Virginia University. While working for NASA she began to use her mathematics to help with computers. Her math and computer skills accurately calculated Alan Shepard's orbital mission. Again even at this level she was met with adversity being segregated at times. She continued working at NASA from 1953-1986. President Barack Obama presented her with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2015.</p>
      <h4>Notable Contributions:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="strong italic">1961</span> - Worked on calculating the trajectory for Alan Shepard's Freedom 7 Mercury capsule.</li>
          <li><span class="strong italic">1969</span> - Worked on calculating the trajectory for the Apollo 11 flight to the Moon.</li> 
          <li><span class="strong italic">1970</span> - Worked on the Apollo 13 mission and helped chart a safe path for the crew to return to Earth after the mission was aborted.</li>  
      </ul>
