      <h4>Biography</h4>
      <p><span class="strong">Grace Brewster Hopper</span> was an American computer scientist. Even at a young age, her curiosity in things led her to dissassemble alarm clocks to understand how they worked. Her desire to learn about things pushed her to earn a Ph.D from Yale University. Afterwards she enlisted in the Navy and worked with them for 42 years earning the level of admiral. Meanwhile, she was one of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer. She was a pioneer of computer programming who invented the first compiler. Hopper's contributions influenced the development of COBOL, a programming language still in use today. The country and world honored her time and time again. Even as late as 2016, she was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama.</p>
      <h4>Notable Contributions:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="strong italic">1947</span> - Helped coin the phrase "debugging" due to an actual moth that flew into the computer she was working with</li>
          <li><span class="strong italic">1951</span> - Developed the first implemented compiler to translate English words into machine code</li> 
          <li><span class="strong italic">1959</span> - Helped develop one of the first compiled programming languages COBOL</li>  
      </ul>
      <h4>Famous Quote:</h4>
      <blockquote>"The most damaging phrase in the language is: 'It's always been done that way.'"</blockquote>
